    <h1>Capybara</h1>
    <p>The capybara is a large rodent species native to South America that is a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. It is the largest living species of rodent and can grow up to 1.3 meters in length and weigh up to 66 kilograms. Capybaras have a distinctive appearance, with brownish-gray fur and webbed feet, which are adapted for their semi-aquatic lifestyle. They are excellent swimmers and are often seen near water sources, such as rivers, lakes, and marshes.

        Capybaras are social animals and live in groups of up to 20 individuals. They are herbivores and feed mainly on grasses and aquatic plants. They are active mainly at dusk and dawn and spend much of their day resting. They are also known for their calming nature, and their ease around humans has led to them being kept as pets in some countries. Despite their gentle demeanor, capybaras are considered a nuisance in some agricultural areas, where they may damage crops. Conservation efforts are underway to protect the species, which is listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).</p>
